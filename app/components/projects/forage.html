                <p class="forageSent">Forage is a web application that allows customers to locate food trucks near their area. It has one sign up page, that lets owners/users switch back and forth without having to make separate accounts. Users can send private messages, order online, receive updates on specials through text messages, and review different food trucks. Owners can turn on their location, adjust the menu, post hours of operation, and receive private messages. Forage makes it easier for food trucks to promote their business by customers seeing their location and being able to communicate with them through the website.</p>

                <h1 class="forageHeader">RESPONSIBILITY</h1>
                <p class="forageSent">I started the project by brainstorming on a large sheet of paper. While brainstorming I wrote down the views, end points to connect the front end of the application, and data schema. After planning the project I began researching new technology to apply it on the project. I made a mock up that helped guide me from start to finish with coding. Once the project was completed I hosted my website for others to view it.</p>
