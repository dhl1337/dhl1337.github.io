Each individual has their own profile, which allows others to rate and review their experiences. If there is a post that you are interested in click on the star and it will save the post into your “favorite” tab. Everyone can use a hand every once in awhile, therefore with the Favour website it makes interacting with the local community convenient.</p>

                <p class="favourSent">I planned the project by writing it out and putting all my ideas into a wire frame. I like being able to visualize my idea of what I wanted the project to look like. There were new technologies that I was interested in using, therefore I began teaching myself and applied it to my project. After I thoroughly planned my project I began to code. If there were any bugs found in the code, I debugged it in a quick and efficient way to ensure my projects stays on track. Once the project was completed I hosted my website for others to see it. </p>
